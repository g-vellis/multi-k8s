# For example, the following Ingress routes traffic requested for first.bar.com to service1,
# second.foo.com to service2, and any traffic to the IP address without a hostname defined in request
# (that is, without a request header being presented) to service3.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
   name: ingress-service
   # Anotations are essentially additional configuration options that are going
   # to specify higher level configuration around the Ingress object that gets created.
   annotations:
      # This configuration tells k8s that we want to create a Ingress Controller
      # based on the nginx project.

      # Immediately after, we are going to add in another configuration rule that is going to
      # specifically configure how our copy of nginx behaves.
      #
      # In particular, it says that if we end up matching a route like "/api",
      # after deciding to send it to the server, we are going to do first
      # a little bit of a re-write on the request, and essentially it is going to
      # remove the "/api" part.
      #
      # See figure below to see what exactly this line does.

spec:
   # Our rules say that there are two possible paths that we can match traffic to.
   #
   # The service listens by default on ports: 80 and 443.

              # client-cluster-ip-service.
